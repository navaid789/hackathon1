# Capstone Autonomous Humanoid System Diagram

## Description
This diagram illustrates the complete end-to-end autonomous humanoid system showing the Voice → Plan → Navigate → Perceive → Manipulate pipeline.

## Components to Include
- **Voice Interface**: Speech recognition and natural language understanding
- **Task Planning**: High-level task decomposition and planning
- **Navigation System**: Path planning and execution
- **Perception System**: Object detection and scene understanding
- **Manipulation System**: Grasp planning and execution
- **Robot Platform**: Humanoid robot with integrated sensors and actuators
- **Integration Layer**: System coordination and state management

## Visual Elements
- End-to-end pipeline with clear flow direction
- Feedback loops for closed-loop control
- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow between subsystems
- Real-time constraints and timing requirements
- Error handling and recovery paths

## Use Case
This diagram should help readers understand how all components developed throughout the textbook integrate into a complete autonomous humanoid system.
