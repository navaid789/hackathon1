Placeholder for Domain Randomization Process diagram
This would show the domain randomization process for improving sim-to-real transfer:
- Parameter randomization (mass, friction, lighting, etc.)
- Environment variation
- Training with diverse conditions
- Policy robustness improvement
- Validation in real conditions
- Adaptive randomization strategies
