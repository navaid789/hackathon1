# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Architecture Diagram

## Description
This diagram illustrates the Vision-Language-Action system architecture showing the flow from visual input and language commands to robot actions.

## Components to Include
- **Vision Input**: Cameras and visual sensors
- **Language Input**: Speech recognition and natural language processing
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integration of vision and language information
- **Action Planning**: Generation of robot actions from fused information
- **Robot Control**: Low-level control systems
- **Feedback Loops**: Perception-action cycles

## Visual Elements
- Data flow arrows showing information processing
- Clear separation of different processing stages
- Example neural network architectures (CLIP, VLA models)
- Integration points between modalities
- Real-time processing requirements

## Use Case
This diagram should help readers understand how vision, language, and action components work together in an integrated VLA system for humanoid robots.
