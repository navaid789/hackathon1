Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each task includes specific file paths and clear action descriptions. The implementation strategy prioritizes User Story 1 as the MVP, with dependencies clearly mapped between phases.

## Outcome

Task list completed with all requirements addressed. Ready for implementation phase.
